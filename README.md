# **PHASE 1 — Fundamentals (Weeks 1–4)**

Goal: Become fully comfortable with Three.js core concepts.

---

## **Week 1 — Setup + Rendering Basics**

**Topics**

* Scene, Camera, Renderer
* Meshes, Geometries, Materials
* Animation loop (`requestAnimationFrame`)
* Resize handling

**Exercise**
✔ Build a spinning cube with light + shadow.

**Outcome**
Understand the “Three.js ecosystem” and how scenes render.

---

## **Week 2 — Lighting & Materials**

**Topics**

* MeshStandardMaterial / MeshPhysicalMaterial
* Lights: Directional, Spot, Ambient, Hemisphere
* Shadow configuration
* Tone mapping & physically correct rendering

**Exercise**
✔ Create a small “art gallery” with 2–3 objects under realistic lighting.

---

## **Week 3 — Models & Loaders**

**Topics**

* GLTFLoader, TextureLoader
* HDRI environments
* Compression formats (DRACO, Meshopt)

**Exercise**
✔ Import a GLTF model + apply HDRI environment.

---

## **Week 4 — Controls + Interaction**

**Topics**

* OrbitControls
* Raycasting (mouse picking)
* GUI (lil-gui)

**Exercise**
✔ Make objects highlight on hover and show info panel on click.

**Milestone Project #1**
🎯 **Interactive 3D Product Viewer**

---

# **PHASE 2 — Intermediate (Weeks 5–8)**

Goal: Make interactive, polished scenes.

---

## **Week 5 — Animations**

**Topics**

* GLTF animation system
* AnimationMixer

**Exercise**
✔ Animate a character or object (open door, rotate wheels, etc.)

---

## **Week 6 — Textures & UVs**

**Topics**

* Normal maps, roughness maps, displacement
* Repeat/wrapping
* UV troubleshooting

**Exercise**
✔ Create a “material switcher” to toggle textures (wood, metal, plastic).

---

## **Week 7 — Postprocessing**

**Topics**

* EffectComposer
* Bloom
* Depth of Field
* SSAO
* Color grading

**Exercise**
✔ Add a bloom/DOF combination to make a cinematic scene.

---

## **Week 8 — Performance Optimization**

**Topics**

* Render loops, delta timing
* Instancing
* Texture compression
* Frustum culling

**Exercise**
✔ Render 1000+ objects efficiently using InstancedMesh.

**Milestone Project #2**
🎯 **Cinematic Interactive Scene**
(Your imported model + animations + post-processing)

---

# **PHASE 3 — Advanced (Weeks 9–12)**

Goal: Learn shaders & custom effects.

---

## **Week 9 — Shader Basics (GLSL)**

**Topics**

* Vertex / fragment shader structure
* Varyings & uniforms
* Color manipulation

**Exercise**
✔ Build a simple gradient shader.

---

## **Week 10 — Procedural Shaders**

**Topics**

* Noise (Perlin/Simplex)
* Time-based distortion
* Patterns

**Exercise**
✔ Create a procedural effect (water, lava, clouds).

---

## **Week 11 — GPGPU + Particle Systems**

**Topics**

* Data textures
* Large particle fields
* GPU-driven animation

**Exercise**
✔ Build a 10k+ particle system reacting to mouse movement.

---

## **Week 12 — Custom Postprocessing**

**Topics**

* Writing your own shader pass
* Full-screen quad shaders

**Exercise**
✔ Build a custom glitch/warp transition effect.

**Milestone Project #3**
🎯 **Procedural Shader Playground / Particle Experience**

---

# **PHASE 4 — Production Skills (Weeks 13–16)**

Goal: Build **portfolio-ready work** that companies notice.

---

## **Week 13 — 3D Website Integration**

**Topics**

* Scroll-driven animation
* React Three Fiber (optional but recommended)
* Responsive performance strategies

**Exercise**
✔ Make a small hero section with scroll-triggered movement.

---

## **Week 14 — Asset Pipelines**

**Topics**

* Blender → GLTF workflow
* LODs (Levels of Detail)
* Baking lighting, textures

**Exercise**
✔ Optimize a GLTF from 10MB → <2MB.

---

## **Week 15 — Final Project Assembly**

Build your **flagship portfolio project**:

🔥 **Ideas (pick one):**

* Car configurator
* Interactive 3D landing page
* Particle-based website hero
* Architectural walkthrough
* Mini 3D game scene with shaders

---

## **Week 16 — Deployment & Polish**

**Topics**
